## 3rd Party Vendor Libraries

*3rd Party Vendor Libraries* are libraries written and distributed by component manufacturers for use in interfacing with their components. To install REVLib or the CTRE Phoenix library:
1. Install their respective software. 
	- ForREVLib, download the [Java/C++ API](https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/software-resourcâ€‹es/spark-max-api-information#c++-and-java) (big orange button with "Download latest Java API" on it) and unzip into the C:\Users\Public\wpilib\2023 directory on Windows or ~/wpilib/2023 directory on Linux. 
	- For the CTRE Phoenix library, download and install the [Phoenix Framework](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/software/). 
2. Next, in VSCode, press the wpilib icon in the top right in your project and go to `WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries` then `Install new libraries (offline)` and select `REVLib`, `Phoenix (v5)`, or both.

**Do not** install the `Phoenix (Pro)` library, as it is locked behind a paywall and will prevent your code from running. To uninstall a library, go to `WPILib: Manage Vendor Libraries` again and select `Manage current libraries`, then select any libraries you wish to remove and press enter.

## Dashboard Values:

One very useful feature of WPILib is the ability to post values to a dashboard. This can be used to show values for debugging, display useful information while driving, etc. Of the several options for dashboards included with WPILib (including making your own), we use Shuffleboard because it looks nice, is simple to use, and is feature rich. There are two methods for putting values on Shuffleboard: 
- Using the API for SmartDashboard, an older dashboard with less features
	- Shuffleboard can read values from SmartDashboard's API and will automatically display them on its `SmartDashboard` tab
- Using Shuffleboard's own API, which supports specifying which tab to place the value on, along with other features
The SmartDashboard API is the simpler option, but does not support tab placement, widget type selection, positioning, etc. As such, the SmartDashboard API should be used for quick testing, but the ShuffleBoard API should be used for production.

### SmartDashboard:

You can put Boolean, Numeric, or String values on the dashboard very simply by including `<frc/smartdashboard/SmartDashboard.h>` and calling `frc::SmartDashboard::PutBoolean`/`PutNumber`/`PutString` with the parameters `("Displayed Name", [value])`. The value should appear on Shuffleboard on the `SmartDashboard` tab. ([docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/smartdashboard/displaying-expressions.html))

### Shuffleboard:

To put values on Shuffleboard, include `<frc/shuffleboard/Shuffleboard.h>` and declare a `nt::GenericEntry*` for each value that you will need to update. Then, in your constructor, set your variables to the return of this:
```C++
frc::Shuffleboard::GetTab("Your Tab")
    .Add("Your Value Name", 3.14)
	.GetEntry();
```
This will function creates a tab if it does not exist, then creates a value on that tab if it does not exist, it then returns the NetworkTable entry for setting, note that this will not change already existing values. If you need to specify a widget to use, call `WithWidget()` on `.Add()` with a `frc::BuiltInWidgets` as the parameter for the type of widget, and to modify widget properties, call `WithProperties()` with the properties like so:
```C++
frc::Shuffleboard::GetTab("Your Tab")
    .Add("Your Value Name", 3.14)
    .WithWidget(frc::BuiltInWidgets::kNumberSlider)
    .WithProperties({ // specify widget properties here
      {"min", nt::Value::MakeDouble(0)},
      {"max", nt::Value::MakeDouble(10)}
    })
    .GetEntry();
```
To specify the size or position, call `WithSize()` or `WithPosition()`, where `WithSize()` takes the height then width, and `WithPosition()` takes the row and column, starting at (0, 0) in the top left corner. You can also specify a layout for the widget by calling `GetLayout("Layout Name", frc::BuiltInLayouts::WantedLayout)` after `GetTab()`. Finally, you can open a tab from code by calling `frc::Shuffleboard::SelectTab("Tab Name");`. Read in more detail on the [docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/layouts-with-code/index.html)

### Reading Values:

On Shuffleboard, you can make a value selectable by calling the type-specific get method on a `nt::GenericEntry*` created in the [Shuffleboard](#shuffleboard) section (make sure to make the widget something modify-able). For example:
```C++
	doubleEntry = frc::Shuffleboard::GetTab("Your Tab")
    	.Add("Number", 0)
		.WithWidget(frc::BuiltInWidgets::kNumberSlider)
		.GetEntry();

	double number = doubleEntry->GetDouble(0.0); //parameter is the default value

	boolEntry = frc::Shuffleboard::GetTab("Your Tab")
    	.Add("Boolean", false)
		.WithWidget(frc::BuiltInWidgets::kToggleSwitch)
		.GetEntry();

	bool doTheThing = boolEntry->GetBoolean(false);
```
Make sure that you do not set the value too often, as it will make it difficult for you to get input reliably.

## NetworkTables:

Another feature of WPILib is NetworkTables, which can be used to communicate values between the driverstation computer, the RoboRIO, and any coprocessors such as Raspberry Pi's the robot my have on it. All NetworkTable values are copied to all devices connected to networktables, and values are organized similarly to a filesystem, where the folders are "subtables" and the files are "topics", which is the NetworkTables term for values. You can reference a value by accessing its table similarly to opening a folder, then declaring a `subscriber` to read values or a `publisher` to write values.
1. In your header, include `<networktables/NetworkTable.h>`, `<networktables/NetworkTableInstance.h>`, and the topic for the data type you are working with, for example a float: `<networktables/FloatTopic.h>`
2. Declare a private `NetworkTablesInstance`, a `shared_ptr<nt::NetworkTable>`, and a subscriber or publisher for the data type:
	```C++
	nt::NetworkTableInstance networkTableInst; //the default networktables network
	std::shared_ptr<nt::NetworkTable> table; //the table to be used

	nt::FloatSubscriber subscriber; //able to read values

	nt::FloatPublisher publisher; //able to write values
	```
3. In the source file constructor, set the values to read from the topic you want:
	```C++
	networkTableInst = nt::NetworkTableInstance::GetDefault(); //the network the RoboRIO and DriverStation are connected to
	table = networkTableInst.GetTable("YourTable"); //if the table does not exist, it will be created

	subscriber = table->GetFloatTopic("YourTopic").Subscribe(0.0); //will create the topic if it doesn't exist, 
		//Subscribe() parameter is the default value

	publisher = table->GetFloatTopic("YourTopic").Publish(); //will create the topic if it doesn't exist, 
	```
4. Read or write values:
	```C++
	subscriber.Get(); //returns the float value topic is currently set to
	publisher.Set(124.5); //takes a float to set the topic value to
	```

## Solenoids

Solenoids are the controllers and valves for air-powered devices, generally pistons. We use double solenoids, which have three settings: Forward, Reverse, and Off. The solenoid should never be in Forward or Reverse for longer than a fraction of a second (about 3 ms), just long enough to move the piston. It must then be set to Off again in order to avoid damaging the piston. There is a sample subsystem and command available for them [here](Command_Based#generalized-solenoid-subsystem-and-command). ([docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/hardware-apis/pneumatics/pneumatics.html))
