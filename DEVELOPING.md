# Developing

## Getting started

See the [getting started guide](https://github.com/Brown-County-FIRST-Robotics/Software-Setup-Guide) to setup your computer.

The first task will be to understand how the robot code works. We need to write a document that explains how our robot works. See #6

## How we use GitHub

We are using this repository to track all aspects of the robot code.

The code can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/Brown-County-FIRST-Robotics/1716-2023-robot). The issues to track work that needs to be done is in [issues](https://github.com/Brown-County-FIRST-Robotics/1716-2023-robot/issues). The projects [board](https://github.com/orgs/Brown-County-FIRST-Robotics/projects/1) that will show in what stage of development

### How to commit changes

No code should ever be directly pushed to the main branch. You should create a branch to work on changes then create a pull request to merge the code into main. We will document how this works in the future, for now just ask @joshbressers for help.

Once you have created a PR, it needs to be approved by another team member.

Whoever approves the PR should not merge it. It is up to the author of the PR to merge the changes. Once the changes have been merged into main, you can delete the branch and use a new branch for the next feature.

### Issues

All work we do should be driven by issues. Issues belong on the project board. You can see the issues on the [issue page](https://github.com/Brown-County-FIRST-Robotics/1716-2023-robot/issues). An issue with bad details is more important than a perfectly written issue. Start with quick notes and fill in details later. Even quick ideas are best saves as issues.

All issues will appear by default on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Brown-County-FIRST-Robotics/projects/1). The idea of the board is issues travel from left to right as they are being worked on. The board is a nice way everyone can see the status of the project.

Please assign an issue to yourself when you are working on something. Feel free to add various tags to let other team members know more about the issue.
